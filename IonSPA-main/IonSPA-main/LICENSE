IonSPA Software Academic License Agreement

The IonSPA software ("Software") has been developed by the contributing researchers James S. Prell
and others at the University of Oregon ("Developers") and made available through the University of Oregon ("UO") for your internal, non-profit research use. The Software was developed with funding support from UO and the National Institutes of Health. UO and the Developers allow researchers at your Institution to run, display, copy and modify Software on the following conditions:

1. The Software remains at your Institution and is not published, distributed, or otherwise transferred or
made available to other than Institution employees and students involved in research under your supervision.

2. You agree to make results generated using Software available to other academic researchers for non-profit
research purposes. If You wish to obtain Software for any commercial purposes, including fee-based service
projects, You will need to execute a separate licensing agreement with the University of Oregon and pay a
fee. In that case please contact: techtran@uoregon.edu. 

3.  You retain in Software and any modifications to Software, the copyright, trademark, or other notices
pertaining to Software as provided by UO and Developers.

4. You provide the Developers with feedback on the use of the Software in your research, and that the
Developers and UO are permitted to use any information You provide in making changes to the Software. All bug
reports and technical questions shall be sent to the email address: jprell@uoregon.edu

5. You acknowledge that the Developers, UO and its licensees may develop modifications to Software that may be
substantially similar to your modifications of Software, and that the Developers, UO and its licensees shall
not be constrained in any way by You in Developer’s, UO’s or its licensees’ use or management of such
modifications. You acknowledge the right of the Developers and UO to prepare and publish modifications
to Software that may be substantially similar or functionally equivalent to your modifications and
